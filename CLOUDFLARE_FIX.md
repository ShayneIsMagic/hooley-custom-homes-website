- Click **"Settings"** tab (top navigation)
- Scroll down to **"Build & deployments"** section

### 4. Edit Build Settings
- Click **"Edit settings"** button
- Update these EXACT values:

```
Framework preset: None
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist
Root directory: [LEAVE EMPTY - this is the key!]
```

### 5. Environment Variables
- Add this environment variable:
  - **Name**: `NODE_VERSION`
  - **Value**: `18`

### 6. Save & Retry
- Click **"Save"**
- Go to **"Deployments"** tab
